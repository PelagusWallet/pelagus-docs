## Sending Transactions

You can find a video tutorial on how to send transactions with Pelagus on the [Quai Network Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuaiNetwork/status/1759657393351192894).

Pelagus Wallet makes it easy to send transactions to and from any shard within Quai Network. Simply click the **Send** button below your account balance to open the transaction send page.

You can _paste an address from any shard_ in the "Send To" field and **Pelagus will handle the rest**.

## Creating New Accounts

You can find a video tutorial on how to create a new account on the [Quai Network Twitter](https://twitter.com/QuaiNetwork/status/1753521689193775453).

Quai Network is a multichain network, meaning that each account within Pelagus corresponds to a specific shard or chain within the network. When creating a new account, you'll need to select the shard/chain you'd like to create the account on.

Click on the **Accounts** tab in the top right of the extension to open the accounts page. Then, click the **Add Address** button to create a new account.
