## Wallet Setup

Once you've installed the Pelagus Wallet extension, you'll be prompted to create a new wallet. Start by selecting whether you'd like to **create a new wallet** or **import an existing one**.

</p>

Then, create a **secure password** for your wallet.

</p>

After you've set a secure password, you'll need to create or import an existing account using a private key or mnemonic phrase. **When setting up a wallet, always store your mnemonic securely. Failure to do so will result in loss of the wallet.**

:::danger
**Do not attempt to import a mnemonic phrase from a network that is not Quai to Pelagus Wallet**. Pelagus has been configured to accept Spanish mnemonics, which are not compatible with other networks.
:::

Now that we've finished setting up and storing our mnemonic, all that's left to do is **pin the extension to your browser toolbar** for easy access and you're ready to start interacting with Quai Network using Pelagus Wallet!
