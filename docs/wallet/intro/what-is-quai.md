title: What is Quai?
---

Quai is a pre-launch cryptocurrency powered by the Quai Network. Quai Network is the first blockchain protocol that is simultaneously decentralized, censorship resistant, and infinitely scalable. Quai, in contrast to traditional cryptocurrencies, functions as a [network of many interoperable blockchains braided together.](https://docs.quai.network/advanced-introduction/multithreaded-execution) Due to a breakthrough discovery that occurred during research on Proof-of-Work, [Quai Network utilizes a new consensus mechanism, Proof-of-Entropy-Minima (PoEM)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04305), which eliminates all consensus-based forks, and enables all Quai nodes to remain in “perpetual consensus.”

The use of an interwoven braid of blockchains means that each Pelagus Wallet account controls many blockchain accounts — one for each Quai blockchain. You can read more about Quai’s multichain architecture and sharded address space in [the Quai docs](https://docs.quai.network/introduction/quai-network).
