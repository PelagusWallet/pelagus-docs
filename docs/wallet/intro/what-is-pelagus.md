title: What is Pelagus?
---

Pelagus Wallet is a browser extension for storing tokens and interacting with Quai Network. Being a browser extension makes Pelagus easy to use, especially for those who have used browser extension wallets like MetaMask before. Pelagus makes it simple to do more than just store tokens; you can also interact with smart contracts and dapps. It's user-friendly and designed to be simple and straightforward, making it a great tool for both beginners and experienced crypto users.  

Pelagus is developed and maintained by the Pelagus team, with input and contributions from community developers. As an open-source project, all code used in the Pelagus Wallet is available on Github. Pelagus Wallet also intends to support user-focused installations by submitting Pelagus to the Edge, Chrome, Brave, and Firefox stores.
